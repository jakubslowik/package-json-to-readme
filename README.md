# package-json-to-readme

[Work In Progress]

This is a fork of [package-json-to-readme](https://github.com/zeke/package-json-to-readme) npm module (version 2.1.1).

I am modyfying it to suit my needs, but the core idea is the same - to gather some data from package.json and inject it into README.md file.
